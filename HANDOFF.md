## *** STANDING BINDING DISCIPLINE — read every resume (Charles 2026-06-19) ***
**MISMATCH -> SOLVER, NOT MECHANISM.** If a result is far from observation, the FIRST hunt is the
SOLVER and our application of it — NEVER a mechanism. In order:
1. What did we leave OUT of the solver? (a term, a coupling, a sector, a boundary)
2. Is it a NUMERIC problem? (convergence, box-control, conditioning, a bug, grid)
3. Did we FREEZE or forget to turn on a degree of freedom?
4. Have we actually EXPLORED THE SOLUTION SPACE with everything on, or only a corner?
Plus the many WAYS to examine the same solve (different bases, grids, seeds, continuation, gauge
tests, independent re-derivation). **Reaching for a mechanism to close a gap is FORBIDDEN** until the
solver is demonstrably complete and the solution space genuinely explored. A mismatch indicts the
solver's COMPLETENESS first, the metric last, and a mechanism never (the import reflex). This is
Principle 1 applied to our own numerics. And: **the microphysics space is UNENTERED, not walled** —
the pre-postulate negative corpus is RETIRED (mine for TOOLING only). BOUND the grid, never FREEZE a
DOF ([[full-dimensional-complete-solver]]); test gravitating-soliton stability by a constraint-respecting
COUPLED re-solve, never off-constraint stiffness ([[gravitating-soliton-stability-test]]). (Also in
CLAUDE.md tripwires + the `.claude/skills/` discipline skills + memory [[solver-first-not-mechanism]].)

## Foundation (the DERIVED native frame the solver now builds on) + read order

**The native UDT frame is DERIVED + verified (2026-07-01) — this is the foundation the new solver stands on** (five docs:
`native_field_equations_constrained_two_player_results.md`, `gp_switch_criterion_results.md`,
`native_geometric_action_results.md`, `seal_matching_junction_results.md`, `round_matter_reduction_results.md`; each
CAS + blind-verified). Metric = constrained-two-player `ds²=-e^{-2φ}c²dt²+e^{2φ}dr²+h_AB dx^A dx^B`; native geometric
action `∫c√h[(Z_φ/2)φ'² + R^{(2)} + W_χ𝒦]`, `W_χ=e^{2φ}(G)/1(P)`; matter is **φ-BLIND** (sources geometry via
`n→h_AB→𝒦→φ`, not `e^{2φ}T`). One open constant `Z_φ` (held fixed; free vs `=8`-with-forced-mixing fork → consilience).

**The OLD static solver is the WRONG FRAME (retained only for the tests).** The p1 MIGRATION solver (`p1_residual`,
`branch_operator`, `full3d_*`, …) realizes the φ-OUTSIDE-the-metric two-player scalar-tensor frame that Phase 1 showed
is a CHOSE extension, NOT canonical UDT. Its `e^{2φ}L_m`/`e^{2φ}T` matter weight is the NON-native artifact that
manufactured the "basin A" runaway; the X=−2e5 was the Cassini KLUGE. `pytest tests/` = **32 passed / 1 xfailed** still
imports these modules, so they STAY until the new solver + test rewrite land (then retire to `legacy/`). Do NOT tune them.

**Durable native-matter facts (SURVIVE, and the new solver uses them):** UDT's native matter = the **S²/π₂ winding**
(`n=x/r`), a scale-free defect; its charge is the **integer TOPOLOGICAL degree N** (native quantization — the "lump"
search was frame-creep, Charles's 2026-06-25 catch). In the new round solver: rigid `f=θ` collapses (I_r=0); the
minimally-free `f(r,θ)` is the next test (see LIVE.md). The φ-angular hunch now appears NATIVELY (Branch-P `𝒦`-source;
the route-B kinetic-completion mixing term; the seal source that charges a matter cell).

**Read order for a new instance:** (0) **LIVE.md FRONTIER block** (THE only-guaranteed-current file). (1) CLAUDE.md
"How we work" + ANTI-HANG + the `.claude/skills/` discipline skills; frontier memory **[[native-field-equations-frontier]]**
+ the principle memories ([[apply-purist-logic-proactively]], [[solution-space-not-imposition]],
[[charles-workflow-preferences]], native-matter-defect-import-discovery, solver-first-not-mechanism). (2) THIS FILE +
the five native-frame result docs + `discreteness_preregistration.md` + `round_matter_reduction_results.md` +
`cell_solver_round.py`. (3) CANON.md (C-2026-06-14-1; C-2026-06-18-1 — both SURVIVE); NEGATIVES_REGISTRY;
FOUNDATIONAL_ASSUMPTIONS_LEDGER. **HANDOFF_ARCHIVE.md + STATE.md + git + `archive/` = the deep historical record.**

## STANDING RISKS — the two flagged open items in the derived frame (Charles 2026-07-01, do NOT lose)
Both are correctly TAGGED (unlike the X-kluge, which was mislabeled `# FREE` and so contaminated silently). A tagged
open choice is manageable; the danger is only if we forget it's open. They come due at DIFFERENT stages — convenient
for keeping them honest.

**RISK 1 — the CONSTRAINED-METRIC FORM (the CHOSE) may WALL OFF the structure we're hunting.** Derived + solid: the
exp clock law `g_tt=-e^{-2φ}` + the reciprocal tie `g_tt g_rr=-c²`. CHOSEN (not forced): static, diagonal, and the
"φ purely longitudinal + h_AB independent transverse" split. The serious danger: if discreteness actually needs a
metric structure our ansatz excludes — OFF-ROUND angular shape, a NON-STATIC/time-live piece, or φ mixing DIRECTLY
into the angular sector at the METRIC level (not just via the matter/𝒦 coupling) — we could scan the round-static
space forever, see only a continuum, and WRONGLY conclude "UDT has no discreteness." **A "round static → continuum"
result must be read STRICTLY as "this SLICE is a continuum," NEVER as the theory's verdict** (whole-before-slice;
frozen-DOF≠verdict). Load-bearing: ALL our derivations are SCOPED to this form — so if it's incomplete they're
PARTIAL, not wrong; the staged plan (round → off-round → time-live) exists to un-freeze these one at a time. This is
the bigger risk to WHETHER we find discreteness at all.

**RISK 2 — the OPEN CONSTANT Z_φ.** (a) **It could become the new X-kluge**: if a quantitative result rides on Z_φ,
the pull to "tune Z_φ until the ratios match" is the exact failure mode we just escaped — the pre-reg fence (held
fixed, ONE global choice, no per-solution retuning, decided BEFORE checking the match, blind-verified) must actually
hold. (b) **The fork is STRUCTURAL, not just a number**: Route B (`Z_φ=8`) FORCES an extra action term `e^φKφ'` (a
longitudinal-transverse = φ-angular coupling); Route A omits it. So "open constant" is really "**is there an extra
coupling term?**" — build in Route A and we may be missing a native channel (possibly THE φ-angular channel). (c)
**Scoped:** Z_φ (overall kinetic normalization) mostly rescales SIZES → it does NOT gate the first question ("are
there isolated cells?"); it DOES gate the QUANTITATIVE program (mass ratios) later. This is the bigger risk to
getting the numbers right and NOT fooling ourselves.

**Shared deep risk = INCOMPLETENESS** (a missing DOF for Risk 1; a missing term for Risk 2). Neither will announce
itself — this is exactly where "keep auditing and digging until it's correct" earns its keep: is this scoped or
general? chose or derived? whole or slice?

## REUSABLE MACHINERY (the old solver = a PARTS BIN, not a foundation) — Charles 2026-07-01
The old 3-D solver was the WRONG frame, but it has TWO layers: the **physics recipe** layer is DEAD (wrong frame),
the **numerical machinery** layer is Category-A ("how we solve", frame-agnostic) and is a REUSABLE parts bin. Raid it
DELIBERATELY, one audited part at a time, as the difficulty climbs — do NOT build on it wholesale.

**REUSABLE (Category-A numerics — mine the METHOD, in `legacy/` + the kept root closure):**
- `glm` step = Levenberg-Marquardt in a conditioned basis + Nielsen damping + line-search (in
  `p1_residual_general_einstein.py::newton_solve_p1`) — a general robust nonlinear solver for when the 2-D/off-round
  problem gets stiff.
- galerkin BC-recombined basis (`galerkin_basis.py`) — bake BCs into the basis for conditioning (the mirror-seal cell
  has its own tricky BCs).
- spectral methods — **`spectral_sph_exact.py` (SH-EXACT angular d/dθ) is the most directly relevant**: the naive
  GL-μ grid mis-differentiated the winding `sinθ` non-convergently; the new `f(r,θ)` winding field is EXACTLY that
  structure. Also `spectral_cheb.py` (Chebyshev radial). GPU batching (torch float64) for large scans.
- the junction/DtN/Israel formalism (already used for the seal JC1/JC2), and the grid/method-convergence harness
  (a pre-reg acceptance criterion).
- **Operational know-how (frame-independent, do NOT relearn the hard way):** the GL-μ-grid-mis-differentiates-winding
  gotcha; the V100/cu121 batched-Cholesky-with-broadcast-factor corruption at batch ≳150 (use explicit inverse +
  matmul); the ANTI-HANG rules (bound the grid, ONE process, never background-poll a solve).

**DEAD (wrong-frame PHYSICS — do NOT reuse the ASSEMBLY):** `p1_residual_general_einstein.py` (the 11-field residual),
`branch_operator.py` / `b1prime_3d_offround_residual.py` (the e^{2φ}-weighted derived operator), the X-continuation,
`solver_action.py` GR-baseline. These build the φ-OUTSIDE-the-metric frame.

**CAVEATS:** (1) the old modules INTERTWINE physics + numerics — you cannot just `import full3d_spectral` (it builds the
wrong metric; the matter EL bakes in e^{2φ}); pull the METHOD, never the assembly, or you re-import the flaw
(Category-A not B; the "audit-solving-infrastructure" discipline applies). (2) The near-term problem is MUCH simpler
(1-D ODE now, 2-D PDE next — scipy-handled; `cell_solver_round.py` is ~60 lines), so for a while a FRESH small tool is
CLEANER than untangling a 3-D module. (3) The parts bin being full is a real head start; assembling from it wholesale
would drag the wrong frame back in.

## Must-not-lose (durable facts)
- DATA-BLIND wall numbers (NEVER load during a derivation): the six lepton wall numbers, contract
  26fc757. We predict RATIOS.
- CANON C-2026-06-14-1 (B=1/A sourced by the angular sector; EOS-softened interior) — SURVIVES.
  CANON C-2026-06-18-1 (metric form derived from relativity) — the new foundation.
- Durable GEOMETRY: the seal = same-minus MIRROR FOLD = TIME REVERSAL (t→−t); Misner-Sharp mass =
  the cell's public charge (Q=2 p_F); q=1/3, N=3, eta=1/18 from the H1 AREA FORM; 7.004 = ln(1+z_CMB)
  via 1+z=e^phi.
- Provenance: commit scripts WITH results docs; AUDIT.md / step0_bridge*.py / dpf_verify_indep.py are
  Charles's untracked working files — leave them.
