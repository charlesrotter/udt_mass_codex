# D1 determinacy fix — DESIGN SPEC (PROPOSAL, pending Charles's BC sign-off)

**Status:** design only — no code edited, no solve. Several BC choices are FLAGGED premises requiring Charles's
sign-off before implementation (anti-imposition + a derived-junction conflict). Design agent `a71a5861c6058a3e7`,
2026-06-29. Recipe: `GR_NUMERICS_RESEARCH_2026-06-29.md`; matter model = verified RIGID unit field
(`matter_amplitude_native_MAP_2026-06-29.md` — no amplitude DOF; that's a gated import).

## The determined posing (the category-A part — clean, mechanical)
Current: PDE on `body=[3:Nr-3]` (2 of 8 radial layers at Nr=8) + patchwork BCs = **1776 rows / 4224 cols**
(underdetermined by 2448). Fix: impose the 11 coupled rows at ALL non-endpoint layers `[1:Nr-1]` (6 layers) +
**11 closure rows at each endpoint** (core rc, seal ri):
- interior 6×48×11 = 3168 + endpoints 2×48×11 = 1056 = **4224 == cols.** Square/determined.
- The 11 per node = 4 diagonal + 3 off-diagonal Einstein + φ-EL + (2 tangential matter EOM + 1 |n|=1 algebraic,
  imposed at every node). Matter contributes only **2** genuine endpoint BCs per end (|n|=1 fills the 3rd slot).
- Determinacy self-check (cheap, no solve): Jacobian SVD/rank on the new posing → expect rank==4224, null-dim 0
  (vs current min-SV 0.029, null-dim 2448). Guard: if rank<4224, two closure rows are dependent — inspect/replace.

## The BC ledger (the load-bearing part — FLAGS need your call)
Domain is [rc=0.1, ri], **no r=0 node** — the singular n=x/r core is already excised by the finite core rc.
Tags: gauge/regularity/parity = ALLOWED (provenance-only); structure-holding/shape = FLAG.

| field | CORE (rc) | SEAL (ri) | flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | **NEW** d_r a=0 (regularity) | a=0 (gauge) | clean |
| b | b=−p (depth dial; **p FREE**, honoring p fixes the D4 bug) | **NEW** d_r b=0 (σ-even Neumann) | clean |
| c | **change** c=0 → d_r c=0 | **change** c=0 → d_r c=0 | **FLAG** |

| n1,n2,n3 | d_r n̂_⊥=0 (2 tangential; degree from seed homotopy, no Θ-pin) | n̂→vacuum dir (2 tangential; sector label) | confirm sector-not-shape |
| φ | **NEW** d_r φ=0 (finite-core regularity) | φ=0 (canonical interface C-2026-06-10-2) | **FLAG (×2)** |
| e_rt,e_rp,e_tp | e=0 (regularity) | e=0 | **FLAG (seal); parity owed** |

### The three things for Charles to decide
1. **c,d (both ends) + e_* (seal): Dirichlet value-zeros → switch to Neumann (d_r=0)?** TWO reasons this isn't
   just my preference: (a) the current c=0/d=0 **imposes the metric round / no-shear at the boundaries** =
   structure-holding (the imposition the gate forbids); (b) the current Dirichlet **CONFLICTS with UDT's OWN
   DERIVED mirror-fold seal junction**, which gives σ-even fields (A,B,φ,Θ) **Neumann**, not Dirichlet
   (`seal_junction_condition_results.md:66-93,156-159`). So Neumann is *both* less-imposing *and* consistent with
   the derived junction. **Recommendation: yes, switch — it's more correct, not just a choice.** (Off-diagonal
   e_* parity is component-specific — Boyd per-component rule owed before fixing Neumann-vs-Dirichlet there.)
2. **φ tension:** φ(seal)=0 is the canonical matter-cell interface *definition* (C-2026-06-10-2), but the derived
   σ-even junction would say Neumann d_rφ=0. And the new φ-core Neumann rides the posited inner-core treatment
   (a CHOSE). These touch CANON — your call: keep φ(seal)=0 as the interface definition (my lean — it's a
   definition, not a fold-junction), and take φ-core Neumann provisionally.
3. **Matter seal direction-pin** sets the winding sector (charge-1 label). Legitimate, but it pins a direction
   *value* at the seal — confirm it's a sector label, not a shape imposition.
Clean (no decision needed): a (gauge), b (depth-dial; p tagged FREE).

## Biggest IMPLEMENTATION risk (not a BC choice)
Dropping the body excision **re-exposes the core/seal conditioning the excision was hiding** — Chebyshev endpoint
differentiation-matrix amplification on the steep warps (the b1prime header documents flat-space error 1.2e3→3.8e3
growth in the innermost rows with Nr). We must NOT re-excise (that IS D1). Instead handle endpoints via the
**parity/Galerkin basis-recombination** from the research (bakes regularity into the basis, avoids edge
amplification natively) and/or the pole-stable hybrid backbone — and **re-validate the conditioning** (re-run the
flat-space error-growth test). This is the real work; it's why the fix is not a pure flag-flip.

## Owed items now load-bearing (must close before trusting a non-round determined result)
- **SH-exact d/dθ in the GRAVITY sector** (B1/F-4/G8): the off-diagonal Einstein rows are now active at all layers
  → the grid-Legendre d/dθ (exact only at axisymmetry) mixing with the matter SH-exact d/dθ reintroduces the
  non-convergent winding-sin(θ) error. `full3d_grid_shexact.py` exists but isn't wired in. Close it.
- **Per-component tensor/vector parity** (Boyd) for the off-diagonal warps + c,d — pins Neumann-vs-Dirichlet at
  each endpoint; provisional until derived.

## Re-grade plan (after the determined solve converges)
Recompute on the determined field vs the old min-norm values: ρ_max at core, warp magnitudes (max|a..d|, eoff),
charge profile E(<r), caveat #3 warp-comparison. Large movement ⇒ the quantity was seed/Levenberg-set.
Qualitative/topological claims (winding DEGREE, not-a-horizon, gentle-φ) expected to SURVIVE (constrained subspace).

## DERIVED BC TABLE (2026-06-29) — supersedes the proposal above; blind-verified CONFIRMED
Derivation agent `aecae703e65ce043b` + blind adversarial verifier `aeb0ab5cfdb351889` (CONFIRMED; hardest attack
on the parity split survived). The BCs are DERIVED from the seal's mirror-fold geometry (per-component reflection
parity in the radial/normal index) + origin r^l regularity at the core + topological degree-conservation — NOT
posited. This CORRECTS the proposal's table (my blanket "off-diagonals → Neumann" was WRONG).

**Frame:** the seal is the φ=0 spatial mirror fold (radial reflection r→2r_seal−r; canon C-2026-06-10-2). For a
C¹ doubled metric across a totally-geodesic reflection surface, parity = (−1)^(#radial indices): odd → Dirichlet
(=0), even → Neumann (zero normal derivative). The t→−t involution is VACUOUS on static fields (governs only the
absent time-arm g_tr), so the static off-diagonals are fixed by the spatial mirror. Core = finite cutoff (NOT a
mirror) → origin r^l regularity (same off-diagonal pattern, different reason).

| field (slot) | #r-idx | SEAL | CORE | provenance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a (g_tt) | 0 even | a=0 (gauge fix, allowed) | d_r a=0 (regularity) | DERIVED (+gauge) |
| b (g_rr) | 2 even | Neumann ∂_r b=0 | b=−p (depth dial, **p FREE**) | DERIVED (+ p CHOSE; fixes D4) |
| c (g_θθ) | 0 even | even→Neumann* | even→Neumann* | DERIVED |
| d (g_ψψ) | 0 even | even→Neumann* | even→Neumann* | DERIVED |
| φ | mirror var (odd) | **φ=0** (=domain definition) | d_r φ=0 (regularity, rides rc model) | DERIVED + residue 5a |
| n1,n2,n3 | tangential | 2×tangential Neumann + \|n\|=1; **NO value-pin** | same | DERIVED (degree topological) |
| **e_rt (g_rθ)** | **1 odd** | **Dirichlet e_rt=0** | Dirichlet (~r¹) | DERIVED (CORRECTS proposal) |
| **e_rp (g_rψ)** | **1 odd** | **Dirichlet e_rp=0** | Dirichlet (~r¹) | DERIVED (CORRECTS proposal) |
| **e_tp (g_θψ)** | **0 even** | **Neumann ∂_r e_tp=0** | Neumann | DERIVED (CORRECTS proposal) |

***Even-sector FORM refinement (verifier):** the even/odd classification is firm, but the even-sector condition
in WARP variables is ROBIN, not pure Neumann — e.g. ∂_r(g_θθ)=0 with g_θθ=e^{2c}r² gives c′=−1/r_seal (an
r-power coefficient), not c′=0. **IMPLEMENTATION: impose the parity condition on the METRIC COMPONENT (∂_r g_θθ=0,
∂_r g_ψψ=0, ∂_r g_rr=0, ∂_r g_θψ=0) — the geometrically correct statement — rather than on the bare warp.** This
sidesteps the warp-vs-component subtlety. Classification unaffected.

**Matter pin DROPPED (derived redundant):** the winding degree ∈π₂(S²) is conserved under continuous relaxation
while |n|=1 (changing degree needs |n|=0, forbidden) — so the seal direction value-pin is redundant/over-imposing;
2×tangential-Neumann + |n|=1 suffices. Sector label (degree 1) set by the seed homotopy class.

**Not an imposition (verified):** e_rt=e_rp=0 is the geometric requirement that normal-tangential shear vanish on
the crease; the tangential shear e_tp is left FREE (Neumann). The seal does NOT flatten the metric — STRICTLY LESS
imposing than the old c=d=0 round-pinning table. BCs come from the fold geometry, not from us.

**Determinacy unchanged:** Dirichlet↔Neumann is a one-for-one row swap → rows==cols==4224 at Nr=8. SVD/rank
self-check still owed (cheap) post-implementation.

**Residues (only non-derived choices):** (5a) φ(seal)=0 — corpus leans DOMAIN DEFINITION (C-2026-06-10-2) + the
mirror-odd Dirichlet branch; the competing Neumann reading comes from the (vacuous-here) time involution. Proceed
with φ=0 as the derived default; flag for Charles's canon confirmation (he can overrule). (5b) the rc finite-core
model + p FREE = justified CHOSE (core derived-singular). EVERYTHING ELSE IS DERIVED.

## IMPLEMENTED + DETERMINACY VERIFIED (2026-06-29)
The determined posing is implemented as `residual_vector_p1(..., determined=True)` (a branch; the old
`determined=False` path is byte-unchanged, pytest 32/1xfail intact). Determinacy check
(`d1_determined_posing_check.py`, Jacobian SVD at a GENERIC point — the saved converged field — + a
symmetry-broken-seed cross-check):
- **rank == 4224 == cols, NULL-DIM 0** (vs the old null-dim 2448). The D1 underdetermination is FIXED.
  (Seed-only linearization gives a spurious small-SV band from the round symmetry — must check at a generic
  point; both the converged field and seed+noise give null-dim 0.)
- **Conditioning (the predicted risk): smin≈6e-5, smax≈7e6, condition ≈1e11** — full-rank but ILL-CONDITIONED
  (the Chebyshev endpoint amplification from imposing the PDE adjacent to the endpoints). NOT a determinacy
  failure; it is the flagged "real work." Float64 has ~16 digits so ~1e11 is marginally solvable with LM damping,
  but a clean robust re-solve likely needs the parity/Galerkin basis (research recipe) to improve conditioning.
- **STATUS:** determinacy FIXED (banked-pending-blind-verify); conditioning open; re-solve + re-grade next.
- **NEXT:** (1) blind-verify the determinacy (independent rank check); (2) thread `determined=True` through
  newton/continuation, attempt a BOUNDED re-solve (tests whether ~1e11 conditioning is workable or needs the
  basis); (3) re-grade the soft quantities on the determined field; (4) cross-model verify.
