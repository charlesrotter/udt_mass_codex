# LIVE — the only guaranteed-current file (READ ME FIRST)

**The "## ============ FRONTIER ... CURRENT STATE" block below is the ONLY current frontier** — read it and stop;
everything under the "↓↓↓ HISTORICAL ARC" / "SUPERSEDED" fences is labeled-stale detail (mine for history, not the
plan). `HANDOFF.md` / `STATE.md` are detailed history; **if they disagree with this file's CURRENT STATE block, the
CURRENT STATE block wins.**
**Read order (2026-07-07):** LIVE.md FRONTIER (this block — the RESUME-HERE directive at its TOP is the next action =
the NO-BUILD per-rung RESONANCE TEST) → **`classB_rung_resonance_prebuild_test_DESIGN.md`** (the spec: §OWED FIRST =
the blind re-derivation to do first, then the per-rung classification) → `classB_embedded_rung_gatecheck_results.md`
(why the junction is flux/depth, not H) → the Stage-2 arc RESULT docs only if needed (`n5d_stage2_*_results.md`,
`n5d_stage2_MS_boundary_selector_audit_results.md`; the ladder law lives in `stageD_frozen_forecast.md` /
`ladder_lemmaD_sealing_amplitude_results.md`) → CLAUDE.md "How we work" + "DRIVER TRIGGERS" + the `.claude/skills/`
discipline skills → HANDOFF.md §SESSION RECORD 2026-07-06→07 (EOD-3) → INDEX.md (repo map). The closed Stage-2
static-arc detail is archived → `archive/LIVE_stage2_static_arc_2026-07-06.md` (mine only for history).

## Binding method (never skip)
- CLAUDE.md "How we work": MAP / OBSERVE / PONDER are primary, DERIVE is gated. Let structure
  EMERGE; pre-work discussion in LAY language; "chose or derived?" / "observing or targeting?".
- Discipline skills (`.claude/skills/`, auto-loaded): **solver-first**, **verifier-before-record**
  (incl. cross-model escalation), **no-shortcuts** (run `python3 -m pytest tests/`), **completeness-map**.
- **DRIVER TRIGGERS (CLAUDE.md, always-loaded) + harness HOOKS** (`.claude/hooks/corral_trigger.py`, fires on
  Task/Bash/git-commit) make the corral fire WITHOUT being challenged — pause+honesty, never merit; the allowed-lane
  clause (category-A technique always GREEN) is non-droppable. **CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-01 startup): the
  `✓ CORRAL GUARDRAILS ACTIVE` banner appears + the 6 triggers auto-load** (self-check passed). Memory freshness: the
  TOP entry in MEMORY.md is the CURRENT frontier; older FRONTIER-labeled entries are tagged "SUPERSEDED as frontier"
  (durable lesson only); the rest are durable principle-memories. Read the TOP entry + this LIVE file for the live plan. **The auto-loaded memory snapshot can LAG disk
  (observed 2026-07-03): on resume, re-read MEMORY.md FROM DISK — this file + disk memory win over the snapshot.**
- **DATA-BLIND:** never load the six lepton wall numbers during a derivation (contract 26fc757). We
  predict RATIOS.
- **ANTI-HANG:** coupled solves are SLOW — bound the grid (Nr<=16/24), ONE clean process, never
  background-poll a solve.

## ============ CURRENT STATE (2026-07-07 — the full Stage-2 static arc is CLOSED (impl→pilot→collapse→gauge→L-selection→MS→Class-B→rung gate-checks, all committed/pushed/blind-verified); NEXT = a NO-BUILD per-rung RESONANCE TEST (Charles's Der 1-7) that GATES whether a Class-B embedded-rung build is worth it) ============

**➤➤ RESUME HERE / NEXT ACTION (2026-07-07): run the NO-BUILD per-rung RESONANCE TEST (spec =
`classB_rung_resonance_prebuild_test_DESIGN.md`, Charles's Derivations 1-7).** The Stage-2 static arc has CONVERGED on
this: the isolated Class-B charged cell can't close (needs a receiver); the universe-ladder RUNG is the discrete
receiver; the gate-checks showed (a) the z_CMB anchor cancels in ratios to leading order (`q_i/q_j→(N_j+1)/(N_i+1)`),
(b) `H_amb(N)=0` is a DEAD KNOB, so the real junction is a FLUX/DEPTH match (`q_cell=q_N`, `Δφ_cell=Δφ_N`, NOT H, NOT
raw `φ_s=φ_N` — Class B fixes `φ_s=0` so depth matches a DIFFERENCE `Δφ_cell=φ_c`). **The old no-band wall was NOT a
flux wall (`q≈3.8-4.0` already closed `π_φ`) — it was a MATTER-STRUCTURE wall (R4/R5): Branch A needs `I_r>0` but
minimal matter drains to `I_r≈0`; Branch B blocks on angular-skin energy R5.** So discreteness helps ONLY if a rung
hits a RESONANT boundary target. **THE NEXT PASS (no build): for each rung N compute `(q_N, Δφ_N, I_{r,req}(N), A_N)`
[I_{r,req}(N)=(q_N²/(Zρ_s³)+κN_w²I_{4θ}/ρ_s³−π'_{ρ,amb}(N))/(ξρ_s); A_N=E_{ang,natural}−m_amb(N)] and classify: dead /
positive-branch (I_{r,req}≈0) / turning-branch (A_N≈0) / TRUE candidate (both). BUILD GATE: only a TRUE candidate
justifies a bounded single-rung Class-B build; if none, DO NOT build (matter-structure wall survives).** Matter is
φ-blind so a depth match ⇏ I_r>0 directly — escape is either resonance (cheap, no-build) or geometry-coupled (needs
build). Class-B seal is already coded (`cell_solver_f2d.py` `seal_phi="B"`). Reconstruct `π'_{ρ,amb}(N)`, `m_amb(N)`,
`E_{ang,natural}` from the rung + minimal-matter solution (ladder does NOT tabulate them — flag reconstructed-vs-derived).
**Template tripwire: run as OBSERVE (which rungs hit resonance), never TARGET the lepton ladder.** ⚠ **OWED FIRST
(Charles 2026-07-07): a BLIND re-derivation of the load-bearing identities before the classification is trusted —
independently re-derive `I_{r,req}(N)` (from R4: `π'_ρ=Zρφ'²−ξρI_r+κN_w²I_{4θ}/ρ³`) and `A_N` (from R5), from the
native action NOT from the DESIGN doc (which only TRANSCRIBES Charles's Der 1-7), and confirm the old no-band
two-branch numbers (`q≈3.8-4.0` closed π_φ; minimal matter `I_r→0`). Frame NEUTRALLY (adjudicate, not confirm — this
session's residual-artifact lesson). Only then trust the (q_N,Δφ_N,I_{r,req},A_N) classification as a build gate.**

## DURABLE CANON (must-not-lose)
- CANON **C-2026-06-14-1** (native S² carrier; B=1/A, EOS-softened interior) + **C-2026-06-18-1**
  (metric form derived from "remain relativistic") — both SURVIVE.
- seal = same-minus MIRROR FOLD = TIME REVERSAL (t→−t); Misner-Sharp mass = the cell's public charge
  (Q = 2 p_F); 7.004 = ln(1+z_CMB) via 1+z = e^φ. **D1-CORRECTED (2026-07-04): of the old
  area-form trio, only N=3 (+ the 1+3+5 algebra + structural-i) is NATIVE cargo; q=1/3 and
  η=1/18 are IMPORT-DEPENDENT → targets (d1_angular_constants_native_rederivation.md); the
  matter-cell core = even fold at FINITE depth (canon C-2026-07-03-3, φ→−∞ retired).**
- **This session's canon (2026-07-04/05):** **C-2026-07-04-1** = seal-involution SECTOR SPLIT — the spatial
  depth mirror φ→−φ governs STATIC seal BCs (φ odd ⇒ **Dirichlet φ(r_s)=0**, the flux seal), t→−t governs the
  TIME-ON sector; this CLARIFIES (does NOT overturn) the "seal = t→−t" line above. **C-2026-07-05-1** = P16:
  spinning matter stays **φ-blind** (spin→φ NOT natively available; the physical-metric minimal coupling that
  would give it = a forbidden import) — conservative, not a universal theorem. [Working-hypothesis, not canon:
  a UDT particle = a native Faddeev–Skyrme **HOPFION**, charge = Hopf linking Q_H∈π₃(S²)=ℤ — see the frontier block.]
- Provenance: commit scripts WITH results docs; AUDIT.md / step0_bridge*.py / dpf_verify_indep.py are
